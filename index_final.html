          <h2>Selected Variables Distribution</h2>
          <p>In this project, I am analyzing and visualizing the demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I will try to answer the following questions:
          <li>Did people's socioeconomic status help them to get into a lifeboat?</li>
          <li>How did being with family affect their chance for survival? What about gender and age?</li>          
          </p>

          <p> The above depicted charts are the distribution of the following variables in the dataset: Gender, Socio-economic, Age, Traveling Alone.</p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
         <br/>
        </div>      
        <div class = "text">
          <p> We may say that people with higher socioeconomic status had a better chance of survival since only 37% of the upper-class passengers could not survive while 76% of lower-class passengers perished. In addition, we have shown in our sample that being with family affected passengersâ€™ survival chance because 70% of passengers who were traveling alone could not survive while the same factor for people who were traveling with their family is around 51%. Also, the study shows that women and children had a better chance of survival in the accident.</p>
