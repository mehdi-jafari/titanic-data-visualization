          <h2>Selected Variables Distribution</h2>
          <p>In this project I'm analyzing and visualizing the demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I will try to answer the following questions:
          <li>Did people's socioeconomic status help them to get into lifeboat?</li>
          <li>How did being with family affect their chance for survival? waht about their gender and age?</li>          
          </p>

          <p> The above depicted charts are the distribution of the follwoing variables in the dataset: Gender, Socio-economic, Age, Traveling Alone.</p>

          <h2>Summary</h2>
         <br/>
        </div>      
        <div class = "text">
          <p> We may say that people with higher socioeconomic status had a better chance for survival since 37 percent of upper class passenger could not survive while 76 percent of lower class passengers died. In addition, we have showed in our sample that being with family affected passengers survival chance since 70% of passengers who were traveling alone could not survive while the same factor for people who were traveling with their family is around 51 percent. Also, the study shows that women and children had better chance of survival in the accident.</p>
